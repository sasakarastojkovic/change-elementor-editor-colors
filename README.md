# How to change Elementor editor colors

All web designers and developers who use Elementor for producing websiters for clients are facing unwanted editor changes from Elementor 3.12.0. Pink is now dominant color in preview editor, and the other elements are causing a significant eyestrain.

How to solve this?

The most efficient way is to change page builder, but for you who can't, just follow the next 2 steps:

1. Install [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en) chrome extension
2. Insert provided css code to Stylebot's code tab.

This shoul'd bring back old Elementor editor colors, at least most of it. All suggestions are welcome. </br></br>
